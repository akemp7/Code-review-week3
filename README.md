#### A web application for the week 3 code review at Epicodus, 08/23/19

#### By Anita Kemp

## Description

This webpage allows the user to enter in a number. It will return a range of numbers starting from 0 to the user input. All digits containing either a 1,2, or 3 are replaced by text. Depending on the hierarchy (outlined in the specs), a digit containing a 1 will be replaced by "beep". A digit with a 2 will be replaced by a "boop". And, a digit with a 3 will be replaced by "I'm sorry Dave, but I can't do that."
